# AI Updates for light-s3-client

## Summary of Updates

This file contains a summary of completed updates and changes to the light-s3-client library. Every planner/implementer/verifier session appends its entry here (newest on top) per `plan/working-agreement.md`; the phase index lives in `light-s3-client.md`.

## 2026-07-11 — Plan system introduced (branch improvement/add-ai-automation-plans)

- Adopted the three-role (Planner / Implementer / Verifier) workflow from the example-usage template.
- Added `light-s3-client.md` (overview + phase index), `plan/working-agreement.md`, `plan/architecture.md`, `plan/defects.md`, and 12 planned phases `dacoburn-1` … `dacoburn-12` under `plan/phases/`.
- Retired `ai-tasks.md`: every item in it was already marked Completed and is summarized below, so nothing was carried over; all new work items became phases instead.
- Phase naming convention `<github-account>-<number>` adopted so multiple committers can plan phases without ID clashes.

## Version 0.0.30 Updates

- Initial implementation of light-s3-client library
- Core S3 operations: download, upload, delete, list, and get_object
- AWS Signature Version 4 authentication implementation
- Basic error handling with custom exception types
- Support for S3-compatible APIs
- Integration with requests and xmltodict libraries

## Version 0.0.31 Updates

- Fixed AWS Signature Version 4 implementation to use SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 as required by AWS
- Fixed delete_file method to return correct boolean values (True for successful deletion, False otherwise)
- Added Content-Type header for uploads with default 'application/octet-stream' value
- Fixed inconsistent date format usage - standardized on consistent date formatting throughout the library

## Version 0.0.32 Updates

- Improved error handling in do_request with better differentiation between network errors and S3-specific errors
- Added support for head_object functionality that checks object existence and returns metadata
- Added multipart upload support for large file uploads with configurable part sizes
- Added object tagging support with put_object_tagging and get_object_tagging methods

## Version 0.0.33 Updates

- Split `__init__.py` logic into sub-modules for better organization and maintainability
  - Created `buckets.py` for bucket-related operations (list_objects, get_object, head_object, get_bucket_keys)
  - Created `files.py` for file operations (download_file, upload_fileobj, delete_file, create_download_folders)
  - Created `objects.py` for object tagging operations (put_object_tagging, get_object_tagging)
  - Created `auth.py` for authentication operations (create_aws_signature, _get_current_date, _get_server_url, build_vars)
  - Created `multipart.py` for multipart upload operations (upload_file_multipart, _abort_multipart_upload)
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing API interface

## Documentation Updates

- Converted README from RST to Markdown (README.rst → README.md) for better AI compatibility
- Updated pyproject.toml and setup.cfg to reference README.md
- Updated ai-instructions.md with missing function documentation (upload_file_multipart, head_object, put_object_tagging, get_object_tagging)
- Added comprehensive docstrings for all methods in all modules
- Enhanced README with complete usage examples for all functions
- Improved parameter documentation and return value descriptions for all methods

## Pylance Linting Fixes

- Fixed `Optional[str]` type annotations for parameters with `None` defaults in `do_request` and `Client.__init__`
- Added `TYPE_CHECKING` block with method stubs in `Client` class for proper Pylance type resolution of dynamically-bound methods
- Converted dynamic `Client.attr = func` bindings to `setattr()` calls to avoid Pylance "Cannot assign to attribute" errors
- Bound `do_request` as a `staticmethod` on `Client` (was previously unbound, causing potential runtime errors)
- Bound `get_bucket_keys` and `create_download_folders` as `staticmethod` for correctness
- Fixed `server` attribute initialization order in `Client.__init__` to satisfy type narrowing

## Testing Improvements

- Added comprehensive unit tests for individual components in tests/test_unit.py
- Implemented mock testing capabilities with unittest.mock for offline testing without real S3 connection
- Enhanced integration test coverage in tests/test_integration.py with better structure and test cases
- Created docker-compose.yml file that sets up a S3-compatible service (MinIO) for testing with proper configuration
- Added comprehensive integration tests using S3 service to test all module functions in proper order: create bucket, put test files, get files, delete files, delete bucket

## Version 0.0.34 Updates

- Fixed circular import issue in sub-modules (`buckets`, `files`, `objects`, `multipart` were importing `Client` from parent during module load, creating a cycle)
- Removed redundant early `from . import` in `__init__.py` (submodules are already imported after `Client` is defined)
- Added `S3Error` base exception class; `BucketNotFound`, `AccessDeniedToBucket`, and `UnknownBucketError` now inherit from it
- Removed stale `setup.cfg` (superseded by `pyproject.toml`)
- Implemented proper AWS Signature Version 4 authentication (previously was V2 despite docstrings claiming V4)
  - V4 implements canonical request, signing key derivation, `X-Amz-Date`, and `X-Amz-Content-SHA256` headers
  - Added `signature_version` parameter to `Client.__init__` (default `"v4"`, supports `"v2"` for legacy)
  - Updated all 12 call sites across `buckets`, `files`, `objects`, and `multipart` modules
  - `create_aws_signature` now takes `(method, url, headers, payload)` and returns a dict of auth headers
- Switched to `uv` for dependency management (`uv sync` / `uv.lock`)
- Added Python 3.12 and 3.13 classifiers to `pyproject.toml`

## Version 0.0.35 Updates

- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow failure: `hatch build` failed with `module 'virtualenv.discovery.builtin' has no attribute 'propose_interpreters'` because pinned `hatch==1.14.0` bundled a `virtualenv` incompatible with newer environments
- Pinned `python-version` to `'3.13'` in `python-publish-test.yml` and `python-publish.yml` workflows
- Removed version pins on `hatch` and `hatchling` in both publish workflows to let pip resolve compatible dependency versions
- Removed redundant `pip install hatchling` from the build step in `python-publish.yml`
